# Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Data
Choose Shanghai in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for Shanghai. Thoroughly audit and clean your dataset, converting it from XML to JSON format. Then import the cleaned .json file into a MongoDB database.
